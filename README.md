# Master-Thesis---Political-factors-and-Sovereign-Defaults---OLS-


In this repository I uploaded My Master's Thesis project: an empirical analysis investigating the role of political factors in sovereign debt defaults through OLS, including time and country fixed effects, in STATA.


This repository contains STATA code for an empirical analysis of sovereign debt defaults and haircuts, focusing on political and financial economic determinants. The methodology uses a Fixed Effects OLS model, which controls for both country-specific unobserved factors and time-specific shocks, enhancing the robustness of the results.


Key aspects of the methodology include:


- Country Fixed Effects: Controls for unobserved heterogeneity across countries.


- Time Fixed Effects: Adjusts for common shocks or trends affecting all countries over time.


- Robust Standard Errors: Clustering errors at the country level to account for intragroup correlation.


- Logarithmic Transforms & Lags: Used to linearize relationships and address reverse causality.


- Robustness checks, such as multicollinearity analysis, significance of time fixed effects, and instrumental variable tests for legislative elections, ensure the reliability of the findings. The STATA code also 


- includes diagnostics to check for heteroskedasticity and serial correlation.


- By running the provided code, users can replicate the analysis and examine the relationship between political and financial factors and sovereign debt outcomes.
